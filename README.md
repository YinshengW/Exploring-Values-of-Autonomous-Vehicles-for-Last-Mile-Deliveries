# Exploring-Values-of-Autonomous-Vehicles-for-Last-Mile-Deliveries
Course Project for IND E 570 at University of Washington
This project mainly follows a streamline of research in modeling the value of involving autonomous vehicles into the delivery system, which mainly includes two papers, one in Management Science (Reed, Campbell, and Thomas 2022b) and the other in Transportation Science (Reed, Campbell, and Thomas 2022a). Both of two papers focus on the CAVADP model, which models an autonomous vehicle that can drop off the delivery person at selected points where the delivery person makes deliveries to the final addresses on foot. We discussed several assumptions of the model, tested the key theorems in the distinct solution algorithm and implemented the mixed-integer programming of the full model. The project provides some insights on formulating and solving the optimization models in last-miles deliveries, and laid foundations for future research.
